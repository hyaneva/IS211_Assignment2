Test the program with the raw version of another dataset (birthdays_modified.csv) in the repo - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyaneva/IS211_Assignment2/refs/heads/master/birthdays_modified.csv

assignment2_TEST_FILE.py is a file that simulates CLI, which was needed because I made this program in jupyter notebook originally. 
assignment2.py is meant to be run from a CLI.
